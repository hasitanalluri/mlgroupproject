## 1. What is an observation in your study?

## 2. Are you doing supervised or unsupervised learning? Classification or regression?

## 3. What models or algorithms do you plan to use in your analysis? How?

## 4. How will you know if your approach "works"? What does success mean?

(djx3rn): Depending on the model approach we decide to use, there is a general class of predictor metrics for each of them. They will mainly be cross-entropy, R^2, RMSE, MSE, and Accuracy. Usually, the success of a predictive model just means better than if you predicted the "normal" choice i.e. predicting the majority class or predicting the mean or median value of the target value.

## 5. What are weaknesses that you anticipate being an issue? How will you deal with them if they come up? If your approach fails, what might you learn from this unfortunate outcome?

### Identify potential weaknesses and how you plan to address them:


### If your approach fails, consider what you might learn:

(djx3rn): One of the more intriguing things, is actually if this works, is understanding the nature of predictive modelling. The professor has brought up the problem of drawing causal inferences from models in class and how that is an entirely different ball game than statistical learning. I largely agree with that, so it's a question of why it's so effective without theory. That is to say, I have little knowledge of this phenomenon we're modelling, but the model does, and is that enough? Especially considering the NN non-linear proofs about how you can fit/train a non-linear function to match some other function e.g. fitting a representation of kinematics. I don't know, but it intuitively feels wrong to say fitting say observations for F=MA means deriving the equation from theory.

(djx3rn): Besides the above, if it actually does end up failing. We might have run into problems with having unpredictable variables in the model, badly measured data, and the problem of not having domain knowledge when creating models.
